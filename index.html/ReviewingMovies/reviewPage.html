    <p><b>Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)</b></p>
    <p>
        When this movie first came out, I didn’t care for it
        because I didn’t know much about them. However, after watching it,
        I was impressed with the storytelling and character development.
        Each movie continues to be better than the last.</p>
    <p><b> I will rate Guardians of the Galaxy an 8/10.</b></p>

    <p><b>Back to the Future (1985)</b></p>
    <p>
        In 2019, I finally watched Back to the Future. The time travel element is fascinating,
        and the entire cast portrayed their characters very well.</p>
        <span></span>
    <p><b>I will rate Back to the Future an 8 out of 10.</b></p>
    <span></span>
        Fun fact: If you go to the O'Reilly Auto Parts website, you can find a flux capacitor
        among their products.

    <p><b>Thor: Ragnarok (2017)</b></p>
    <p>By far, the best of the Thor movies. A popular criticism of the Thor franchise is that they
        were overall boring and attempted to be too serious for movies based on comic books.
        This third installment did a complete 180. It was fun, vibrant, and had amazing character development.
        It is widely regarded as one of the best Marvel movies, and I agree.</p>
<p><b>I will rate Thor: Ragnarok easily a 10 out of 10.</b></p>
